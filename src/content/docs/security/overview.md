Defense Unicorns is committed to working on a 0 CVE posture with continuous monitoring, logging, and alerting across a
multi-layered approach to cybersecurity. It ensures secure runtime by closely managing and monitoring software
interactions within DoD environments, verifying software components, and mitigating vulnerabilities in real-time to
maintain a trusted and resilient operational state.

## What makes UDS Secure?

#### Compliance
UDS satisfies up to 90% Technical NIST controls established by the program office security controls for IL-4 and 5
environments.

#### Airgap Native
UDS is designed from the ground up for airgapped systems to support disconnected, semi-disconnected, or highly
secure environments.

#### Secure Baseline Configurations
Customizable "Unicorn Flavors" of UDS incorporate hardened configurations tailored for specific missions. These
configurations include Chainguard images and additional security layers to meet DoD standards, further reducing
vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance.

#### Network Security with Istio
Network Security with Istio: The Istio Service Mesh enforces secure communication between services, providing mutual
TLS (mTLS) encryption, traffic policies, and network segmentation.

#### Continuous Monitoring and Logging
Continuous Monitoring and Logging: UDS leverages tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system health,
performance, and security in real time. Alerts are triggered for any unusual activity or potential breaches.

#### Software Composition Analysis
With Chainguard’s hardened images, UDS continuously monitors the software supply chain, ensuring only verified
components are deployed.

#### Runtime Security with NeuVector
UDS integrates NeuVector to monitor container runtime behavior, detect and block anomalies, and enforce runtime
application security policies.

#### Identity and Access Management (IdAM)
Keycloak provides centralized authentication, enabling single sign-on (SSO) and role-based access control (RBAC) to
restrict access to authorized users.

#### Custom Resource Policies with Pepr
[Pepr](https://pepr.dev/) enables the creation of type-safe policies and operators, ensuring security baselines are
enforced automatically within Kubernetes clusters.

#### Trust on First Use (ToFu) Integration
UDS secures initial trust relationships between services and users, leveraging ToFu to establish trusted connections
without manual setup.

## What does a Zero CVE posture mean?
This means that UDS is designed and maintained to eliminate all critical/high vulnerabilities (CVEs, or Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures) from the software it uses.
